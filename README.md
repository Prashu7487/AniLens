# AniLens: Navigating Trends, Unveiling Insights

Welcome to my AniLens project! This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and how to get started.

## Overview
This project serves as a comprehensive exploration within the domain of anime data, undertaken as part of the CS661 course at IITK. It leverages advanced data analytics and visualization techniques to uncover valuable insights, industry trends, and overall patterns within the anime dataset.

Our endeavor extends beyond mere analysis; we have designed interactive features tailored for anime enthusiasts. Through intuitive filtering options and interactive frameworks, users can delve deep into the dataset to discover hidden gems and lesser-known titles. Additionally, the platform offers functionality for recommending similar anime and facilitating comparisons between two anime titles, enhancing the user experience and facilitating informed decision-making.
